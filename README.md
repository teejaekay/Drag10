# Drag10
2D endless arcade iOS game

Drag10 is the first project I made on my own and where I learned most of the basics of programming.
**I completed this project before learning about Object-Oriented Programming and other 
useful properties of programming. My novice level at the time (2018) is immensely apparent in the code for this project.** 
The code is not pretty and not efficient. I plan on re-coding this app sometime in the future. 

The .MOV file is a screen recorded demo of the game.
